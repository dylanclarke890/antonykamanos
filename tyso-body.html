        <p>Daily:</p>
        <p>
          6hr Juice fast cleansing enables the body to naturally enter detox mode while
          simultaneously flooding it with live nutrients &amp; enzymes.
        </p>
        <p>As we live, eat &amp; breathe, we accumulate toxins in the body.</p>
        <p>
          It is important to take the time to release ourselves from these toxins, as they lead
          to problems with both the body &amp; the mind.
        </p>
        <p>We spend an enormous amount of energy on the constant strain of digestion.</p>
        <p>
          When we follow the 6hr TYSO liquid fast, organs are no longer tied up, and all that
          blood &amp; energy is free to move to the brain, skin, liver, etc. We are able to
          attend to neglected issues our body has not had time to properly repair; we remove
          toxins, and are given a rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the while you are flooding yourself with Turmeric, known to be one of the most
          powerful healing herbs; it is great for bones &amp; joints, and has incredible
          anti-inflammatory properties. It prevents metastases from occurring in many different
          forms of cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turmeric is also a natural liver detoxifier &amp; kidney cleanser; it speeds
          metabolism &amp; aids in weight management. It also heals &amp; alleviates conditions
          of depression, psoriasis, skin damage &amp; arthritis.
